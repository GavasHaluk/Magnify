# About

Magnify is a python application that analyses document images and then extracts their text into a raw text file by using optical character recognition. More technical details and results can be found in the Magnify.pdf file.

## Requirments

This project requires the use of Python as its core language for image processing algorithm with openCV and PIL library. For the optical character recognition component I have used pytesseract. Pytesseract is a wrapper for Tesseract-OCR Engine. It is also useful as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract, as it can read all image types supported by the Pillow and Leptonica imaging libraries.

### Planned Improvements

  - Improve handwriting recognition
  - Improve indent recognition
  - Port it to mobile systems
